Tiny-Track
==========

A simple food log for dieters, created using Node.js, Express, Jade, Bootstrap, and MongoDB.

This is my second project using Node.js and Express.  It's meant to be text-only, mobile-friendly, and to have the application portion work in a single, persistent page.


My TODO
=======

* Add Facebook and Google logins.
* Create an autocomplete for previously entered food names, with data completion.
* Create a graph to show calorie consumption over time.
* Add exercise and weight trackers.

I hope this provides a nice, simple app to use as an example basis for a starting Node.js programmer or a starting point for someone inspired to create a dieting app of some sort.
